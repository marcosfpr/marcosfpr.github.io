      <h3>Highlighted Projects</h3>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>SEALy: Microsoft SEAL bindings for Rust and Python. </strong><br />
        SEALy is a project that aims to create FFI bindings from the famous SEAL library for Rust and Python. The main
        goal of this project is to provide a simple and fast way to install SEAL for both programming languages.
        The SEALy bindings are a continuation from the `seal_fhe` crate, with the support for the CKKS scheme and the
        addition of new features like batch encoders, that allow us to overcome the size barriers of the ciphertext
        tensors and create AI applications easily with high-dimensional encrypted ciphertext.
        The project is still in development and the source code can be found here:
        <a href="https://github.com/marcosfpr/sealy" target="_blank">https://github.com/marcosfpr/sealy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>FedHE: Federated Learning Strategies using Homomorphic Encryption. </strong><br />
        This project is an implementation of Federated Learning strategies using the Flower framework and the SEALy
        library. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple interface to implement Federated Learning
        strategies with Homomorphic Encryption.
        With this project, we can easily train a model in a federated way without sharing plaintext gradients
        to the 3rd party server. The project is still in development and the source code can be found here:
        <a href="https://github.com/marcosfpr/fedhe" target="_blank">https://github.com/marcosfpr/fedhe</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>AdaRank: A boosting algorithm for information retrieval </strong><br />
        AdaRank is a boosting algorithm for information retrieval that aims to improve the ranking of documents in
        search engines. The main goal of this project is to re-implement the AdaRank algorithm in Rust for 
        learning and research purposes. The project source code can be found here:
        <a href="https://github.com/marcosfpr/adarank" target="_blank">https://github.com/marcosfpr/adarank</a>.
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>ATRI: An Experimental Information Retrieval Tool</strong><br />
        Atri is an experimental search engine, implemented from scratch. 
        In this project, a few classic IR models were implemented
        to calculate similarity between the documents of a collection and a user query: Boolean,
        Vector Space, Probabilistic, BM25, Belief Network, Extended Boolean, Generalized
        Vector Space, DFRee, and PL2. In addition, ATRI allows the creation of
        a benchmarking environment for reproducible evaluation of the
        effectiveness and performance on IR through automatic creation of
        ensembles, visualization of effectiveness metrics, and support to
        scientific collections.

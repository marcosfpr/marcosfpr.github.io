      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Rust software engineer @ Vaultree and M.Sc candidate @ Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto. </p>
      <p>My research interests are focused on cyber security, databases, and distributed systems.
        Currently, I am working on secure federated learning (FL) protocols with fully homomorphic encryption
        (FHE). </p>

      <h3>Experiences</h3>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>12/2022 – Current:</strong> Rust Software Engineer at
        <a href="https://www.vaultree.com" target="_blank">Vaultree</a>
        (Remote)<br />
        At Vaultree’s engineering team, I contribute to the development of
        always-encrypted database management solutions for different SQL flavors.
        The Vaultree's FFDUE (Fully Functional Data-in-use Encryption) technology provides a
        Software Development Kit (SDK) that enables businesses to efficiently work with
        fully encrypted databases. In that sense, I've been accumulating experiences developing
        database drivers (JDBC, Python DB API, Rust Clients, etc) and different management products to
        onboard and evolve customers' database schemas. The tools include
        database migration, database replication, shell REPL and TUI environments and more.
      </p>

        ◉ <strong>03/2022 – 12/2022:</strong> Performance Engineer at <a href="https://www.dell.com"
          target="_blank">Dell Technologies<a /> (Remote)<br />
          At Dell, I developed tools to assess Non-Functional Requirements (Performance – Capacity –
          Scalability – Availability – Reliability – etc) of the Dell's Finance
          Services. For that purpose, I worked developing Python automations using Flask, Dynatrace, Docker, SQL,
          etc. Also, I had to use NeoLoad to run stress tests in order to collect metrics that were automatically
          processed afterwards in order to generate official performance reports.
      </p>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>10/2019 – 08/2021:</strong> Undergraduate Research Fellow at <a href="https://ufop.br/"
          target="_blank">Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto<a /><br />
          As a research fellow, I worked on the areas of Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Learning (ML). The
          main contributions of my work were: (i) a research on Learning To Rank (LTR) techniques for multi-label text
          classification problems, (ii) the development from scratch of an end-to-end textual search engine for
          educational and research purposes, and (iii) the development of a focused web page crawler based on genre and
          content.
      </p>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>03/2019 – 10/2019:</strong> Java Full Stack Engineer at <a href="https://site.gorceix.org.br/"
          target="_blank">Fundação Gorceix<a /><br />
          At Fundação Gorceix, I worked as a full-stack Web Developer in a private project of the company.
          Throughout the development process, I worked with Java 9 using the MVC pattern based on the Spring Framework.
          I also had experiences with SQL databases (MySQL and SQLServer), front-end implementation using jQuery, Ajax,
          and Bootstrap.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>ATRI: Experimental Information Retrieval Tool</strong><br />
        Atri is an experimental search engine, implemented from scratch. 
        In this project, a few classic IR models were implemented
        to calculate similarity between the documents of a collection and a user query: Boolean,
        Vector Space, Probabilistic, BM25, Belief Network, Extended Boolean, Generalized
        Vector Space, DFRee, and PL2. In addition, ATRI allows the creation of
        a benchmarking environment for reproducible evaluation of the
        effectiveness and performance on IR through automatic creation of
        ensembles, visualization of effectiveness metrics, and support to
        scientific collections.

      </p>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>SEALy: Microsoft SEAL bindings for Rust and Python. </strong><br />
        SEALy is a project that aims to create FFI bindings from the famous SEAL library for Rust and Python. The main
        goal of this project is to provide a simple and fast way to install SEAL for both programming languages.
        The SEALy bindings are a continuation from the `seal_fhe` crate, with the support for the CKKS scheme and the
        addition of new features like batch encoders, that allow us to overcome the size barriers of the ciphertext
        tensors and create AI applications easily with high-dimensional encrypted ciphertext.
        The project is still in development and the source code can be found here:
        <a href="https://github.com/marcosfpr/sealy" target="_blank">https://github.com/marcosfpr/sealy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>FedHE: Flower Federated Learning Strategies with Homomorphic Encryption. </strong><br />
        This project is an implementation of Federated Learning strategies using the Flower framework and the SEALy
        library. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple interface to implement Federated Learning
        strategies with Homomorphic Encryption.
        With this project, we can easily train a model in a federated way without sharing plaintext gradients
        to the 3rd party server. The project is still in development and the source code can be found here:

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Rust software engineer at Vaultree. I like everything related to data security, databases and distributed
        systems.</p>

      <h3>Experiences</h3>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>12/2022 – Current:</strong> Rust Software Engineer at
        <a href="https://www.vaultree.com" target="_blank">Vaultree</a>
        (Remote)<br />
        At Vaultree’s engineering team, I contribute to the development of
        always-encrypted database management solutions for different SQL flavors.
        The Vaultree's FFDUE (Fully Functional Data-in-use Encryption) technology provides a
        Software Development Kit (SDK) that enables businesses to efficiently work with
        fully encrypted databases. In that sense, I've been accumulating experiences developing
        database drivers (JDBC, Python DB API, etc) and different management products to
        onboard and evolve customers' database schemas. The tools include
        database migration, database replication, shell REPL environments, and more.

      </p>

        ◉ <strong>03/2022 – 12/2022:</strong> Performance Engineer at <a href="https://www.dell.com"
          target="_blank">Dell Technologies<a /> (Remote)<br />
          At Dell, I developed tools to assess Non-Functional Requirements (Performance – Capacity –
          Scalability – Availability – Reliability – etc) of the Dell's Finance
          Services. For that purpose, I worked developing Python automations using Flask, Dynatrace, Docker, SQL,
          etc. Also, I had to use NeoLoad to run stress tests in order to collect metrics that were automatically
          processed afterwards in order to generate official performance reports.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>lt.rs - Learning to Rank for Rustaceans</strong><br />
        `lt.rs` is a Learning to Rank library written in Rust and based on the
        famous RankLib library. The main goal of this project is to provide a
        simple, fast, and memory-safe Learning to Rank library which
        implements a wide variety of LTR models. Currently, lt.rs supports
        only the AdaRank model. The source code can be found here:
        <a href="https://github.com/marcosfpr/ltrs" target="_blank">https://github.com/marcosfpr/ltrs</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>Twitter Trending Hashtags and Mentions: Analytics</strong><br />
        In this small project, I’ve developed a real-time streaming processing
        that consumes the Twitter API through Apache Spark and then plots Web
        analytics about the most commented Hashtags and Mentions on the
        platform. For this project, I’ve used Docker, Docker Swarm, Apache
        Spark Streaming, and Python. The source code can be found here:
        <a href="https://github.com/marcosfpr/spark_streaming_twitter/"
          target="_blank">https://github.com/marcosfpr/spark_streaming_twitter/</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ◉ <strong>ATRI: Experimental Information Retrieval Tool</strong><br />
        The Atri project is an experimental search engine, implemented
        from scratch. In this project, a few classic IR models were implemented
        to calculate similarity between the documents of a collection and a user query: Boolean,
        Vector Space, Probabilistic, BM25, Belief Network, Extended Boolean, Generalized
        Vector Space, DFRee, and PL2. In addition, ATRI allows the creation of
        a benchmarking environment for reproducible evaluation of the
        effectiveness and performance on IR through automatic creation of
        ensembles, visualization of effectiveness metrics, and support to
        scientific collections.
